    "##### Advantages :\n",
    "- Multithreading allows multiple tasks to be executed concurrently within a single process.\n",
    "- By dividing tasks among multiple threads, multithreading can improve the responsiveness of an application.\n",
    "- Threads within the same process share the same memory space, which allows for easy sharing of data and resources among threads. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Disadvantages :\n",
    "- Writing and debugging multithreaded code can be challenging due to the need for synchronization mechanisms and careful management of shared resources.\n",
    "- Creating and managing threads incurs overhead in terms of memory and CPU resources.\n",
    "- As the number of threads increases, managing and coordinating them becomes more complex."
